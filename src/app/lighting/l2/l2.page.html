           <p>  <strong class="vocabulary">LED lights</strong> are a long-lasting, efficient type of light bulb that uses less energy 
            than <strong class="vocabulary">CFLs (compact fluorescent) 
             and incandescent light (IL) bulbs.</strong> Over time they also save you money! LED bulbs utilize

             <p>LEDs are also directional light sources, unlike CFL and IL bulbs, which means they

             When we use LED lights, we reduce the amount of greenhouse gasses we emit into the environment. </p>
