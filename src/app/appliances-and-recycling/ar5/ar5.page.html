           <p>If your refrigerator is located by another appliance or in an area that emits a large amount of heat 
             or in an area that is already hot, it will take more energy to keep things cool, and so will emit more 
             <strong classs="vocabulary">carbon dioxide</strong>.</p>
             <br> 
             <p> Refrigerators work by comparing the outside temperature to the inside temperature in the freezer and
                blowing excess cold air from the freezer to the refrigerator. This balancing act means that it is difficult
                 for efficient functioning in a space that can become very hot or experience wide temperature changes in a short 
                 amount of time.</p>
