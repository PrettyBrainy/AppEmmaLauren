            <p>The <strong class="vocabulary">greenhouse effect</strong> is the trapping of the sun’s warmth in 
              our lower atmosphere, which is contributed to by <strong class="vocabulary">greenhouse gases</strong> 
              and is the main cause of rising global temperatures. A greenhouse gas is a gas 
              that contributes to the <strong class="vocabulary">greenhouse effect</strong> by absorbing infrared radiation.
              <strong class="vocabulary">Carbon dioxide</strong> is one such gas, and is defined as a colorless, 
              odorless gas produced by burning carbon and organic compounds and by respiration.</p>

            <p> The Greenhouse Gas Lab is an exciting simulation of atmospheric temperature
              changes caused by a rise in carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentration. Have humans contributed to
              the rise in CO<sub>2</sub>? Yes, say scientists. Deforestation and our burning of fossil fuels, for
              example, expand the greenhouse effect. This is the warming that happens when Earth’s atmosphere
              traps heat trying to radiate to space from Earth.</p>

              <p>Open the Greenhouse Gas Lab activity sheet! This will guide you as you complete the lab.
              All of the materials, procedures, and information in the lab are listed in this activity sheet.
              Remember to be extra careful with the thermometers and to maintain a loose grip so they don’t
              break and become jagged and sharp.</p>
