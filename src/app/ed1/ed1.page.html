              <p>The <strong class="vocabulary">greenhouse effect</strong> is the trapping of the sun’s warmth in 
                our lower atmosphere, which is contributed to by <strong class="vocabulary">greenhouse gases</strong> 
                and is the main cause of rising global temperatures. A greenhouse gas is a gas 
                that contributes to the <strong class="vocabulary">greenhouse effect</strong> by absorbing infrared radiation.
                <strong class="vocabulary">Carbon dioxide</strong> is one such gas, and is defined as a colorless, 
                odorless gas produced by burning carbon and organic compounds and by respiration.</p>

              <p> The Greenhouse Gas Lab is an exciting simulation of atmospheric temperature
                changes caused by a rise in carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) concentration. Have humans contributed to
                the rise in CO<sub>2</sub>? Yes, say scientists. Deforestation and our burning of fossil fuels, for
                example, expand the greenhouse effect. This is the warming that happens when Earth’s atmosphere
                traps heat trying to radiate to space from Earth.</p>
