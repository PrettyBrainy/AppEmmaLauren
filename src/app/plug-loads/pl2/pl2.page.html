              <p>Talk through your family’s electric bill with your parents. Talk about how much you are spending on electricity in your house and easy ways you can reduce 
                that cost. What you save in dollars you also will reduce in carbon emissions for the planet! For example, 
                what appliances can you unplug when they’re not in use? Is there outdoor lighting that stays on 24-7 that 
                you can turn off during the day? Evaluate your energy bill and use the Energy Vampire Calculator to estimate 
                your savings (link below). </p>
                <br>
                <p>You can also estimate the energy use and cost of electricity for one appliance over 
                the course of a year using the Appliance Energy Calculator (link below). If the dollar figure seems low, 
                remember this: one device or appliance may be no big deal, but everything added together represents the big 
                picture of your carbon footprint.
