           <p> Did you know that even when your appliances are turned off they still 
             pull <strong class="vocabulary">electricity</strong> through your outlet? 
             This is called a <strong class="vocabulary">vampire load</strong>. 
             While your device is in standby, it is still using electricity from your home, 
             costing you money, and raising your <strong class="vocabulary">carbon emissions</strong>.
             We leave many devices plugged in even when they are not in use. Items that 
             include phone chargers, coffee makers, toasters, electric toothbrushes, blenders, 
             and so on remain plugged in all the time, even though we use them in small increments of time.</p>

              <p>Talk through your family’s electric bill with your parents. Talk about how much you are spending 
                on electricity in your house and easy ways you can reduce that cost. What you save in dollars you 
                also will reduce in carbon emissions for the planet! For example, what appliances can you unplug 
                when they’re not in use? Is there outdoor lighting that stays on 24-7 that you can turn off during
                 the day? Evaluate your energy bill and use the Environmental Protection Agency’s savings calculator 
                 (link below) to estimate your savings. If the dollar figure seems low, remember this: one device or appliance
                  may be no big deal, but everything added together represents the big picture of your carbon footprint.</p>

                  <br>

                  <p> Do a thorough search of your house and find the items that you have plugged in that are not in use.
